# NumberGuessingGame
My first ever program I created in Java using Eclipse.

The Number Guessing Game is a game of 5 rounds where the user has to guess The Chosen Number based on a "lower" or "higher" clue, which is received after guessing. The program uses Math.random to random generate a Chosen Number between 1 and 100, which the user has to guess within 5 tries.

Future editions to the program:

1. Make a highscore list - perhaps made with hashmap (key and value pair)
2. Cleaner main method - all the code is writting in the main method, which is far from ideal
3.
